Assignment:
~~~~~~~~~~~

- More system calls
- Donate a test case

Virtual Address Space:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

0x00000000 - 0x7FFFFFFF     (shared kernel RWX)
0x80000000 - 0xEFFFFFFF     (per-thread user RWX)
0xF0000000 - 0xFFFFFFFF     (shared kernel RWX)

User code should not be able to access anything outside the user range

System calls:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look in user/sys.h for information about the system calls you need
to implement

Files:
~~~~~~

- kernel/          contains the kernel files. Do what you want with it.

- user/            contains the user mode program sources

    2 user programs are given (init.c and shell.c)
    You can add other user programs by modeling them after init.c
    make sure you edit the Makefile if you add new user programs

- mkfs/            a utility for building BobFS images. You will
                   not use it directly.

- t0.src           BobFS image for t0

To compile:
~~~~~~~~~~~

    make

To build your test image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    (cd user ; make)

  This will build a file <your csid>.img. Please commit this file along with
  your .ok file

To run tests:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s clean test

To run one test:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    make -s t0.test
